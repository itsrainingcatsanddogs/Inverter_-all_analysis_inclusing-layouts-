Since it is a delay analysis we should do transient anaylsis
Rise Time  - 10 percent of value to 90 percent of value
Fall time -   90 percent of value to 10 percent of value
If we are increasing the transistor size even capcitance value also cahanges to compensate and there will be no much difference in delays
So we are checking how changing of capacitance affects the delays
