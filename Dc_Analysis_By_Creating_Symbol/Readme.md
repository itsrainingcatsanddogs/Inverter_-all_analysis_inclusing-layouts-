Click A to create Symbol
Click E to go into a schematic after creating a symbol and ctrl + e to get out of schematic.
For Simulation graphs - click on simulate -Display-write your variables in our case vin vs vout. 
In order to find a value write the following
suppose i want to find vm that is point at vin =vout
Then Type
meas dc vm when vin=vout
then it prints  the value
